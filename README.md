# qbittorrent_banned_peers
My banned peers for qBittorrent. Mostly for anacrolix/torrent.

Download it as ipfilter.dat, put it in a good place, and set IP Filtering options in Connection in qBittorrent. 

Some peers in these range comsume infinite upload bandwidth, while progress is always zero. They are typical _leechers_.
